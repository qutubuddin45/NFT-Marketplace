NFT Marketplace
Project Description
NFT Marketplace is a decentralized application built on the Core Blockchain that enables users to create, buy, and sell Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The platform provides a seamless experience for digital asset trading with built-in royalty mechanisms and secure smart contract infrastructure.

This project leverages the ERC-721 standard for NFT creation and implements a comprehensive marketplace where creators can mint their digital assets and collectors can discover and purchase unique tokens in a trustless environment.

Project Vision
Our vision is to democratize digital asset ownership and trading by creating an accessible, transparent, and secure NFT marketplace on the Core Blockchain. We aim to empower artists, creators, and collectors by providing a platform that eliminates intermediaries while ensuring fair compensation and true ownership of digital assets.

We envision a future where digital creativity is valued and monetized efficiently, fostering a vibrant ecosystem of digital art, collectibles, and unique assets that can be traded globally without geographical or institutional barriers.
